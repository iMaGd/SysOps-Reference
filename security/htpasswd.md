To add an additional layer of security by implementing HTTP basic authentication for a directory, you'll need to create a password file using `htpasswd` and update your web server configuration to use that file for authentication.


## Ngnix Configuration

1. **Install Apache2 Utilities**

	The `htpasswd` utility is included in the `apache2-utils` package. Let's install it.

	```sh
	sudo apt install apache2-utils
	```

2. **Create an HTTP Authentication User File**

	The following command will create a new file and stores a username (`username`). Replace `username` with the username you want to use for phpMyAdmin login.

	```sh
	sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
	```

3. **Configure Nginx to Use HTTP Authentication**

	Open the Nginx configuration file for your website where the `/pma` location block is defined:

	```sh
	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
	```

	Within the server block, add the `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_user_file` directives like so:

	```nginx
	location / {
		auth_basic "Administrator Login";
		auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd; # Path to the htpasswd file

		# ... existing configuration ...
	}
	```

4. **Verify and Restart Nginx Configuration**

	Test the Nginx configuration to ensure there are no syntax errors:

	```sh
	sudo nginx -t
	```

	```sh
	sudo service nginx restart
	```


## Apache2 Configuration

1. **Install Apache2 Utilities**

	The `htpasswd` utility is included in the `apache2-utils` package. Let's install it.

	```sh
	sudo apt install apache2-utils
	```

2. **Create an HTTP Authentication User File**

	The following command will create a new file and stores a username (`username`). Replace `username` with the username you want to use for phpMyAdmin login.

	```sh
	sudo htpasswd /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd username
	```

3. **Configure Apache2 to Use HTTP Authentication**

	Open the Apache2 configuration file for your website where the `/pma` location block is defined:

	```sh
	sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.com
	```

	Add these lines inside the `<Directory>` directive:

	```apache
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "phpMyAdmin Secure Access"
	AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd
	Require valid-user
	```

4. **Restart Apache2 Configuration**

	```sh
	sudo service apache2 restart
	```
